2. **Login back as the client**

3. Go to **Projects**: `http://localhost:5173/client/projects`

4. Click the **"Proposals"** tab

5. You'll see all freelancers who accepted your job!

### Step 5: Approve & Start Chatting
1. **Click on a freelancer card** to view full details

   - Create an ongoing project
   - Enable chat functionality

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Always create a job first** before running the seed script
- The seed script uses the **most recent job** in the database
- You need **at least one freelancer** in your database
- Make sure you're **logged in as the correct user type**
- After approval, the proposal status becomes **"approved"** and a **project** is created

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No freelancers found"
‚Üí You need to register at least one freelancer account

### "No jobs found"
‚Üí Create a job first at `/client/create-job`

### "No proposals showing up"
‚Üí Make sure you ran `npm run seed:job-proposals` after creating the job

### "Can't approve proposal"
‚Üí Make sure you're logged in as the **client who created the job**

---

## üì± Testing the Full Flow

### Quick Test (5 minutes):
1. Register/Login as **Client**
2. Create a job at `/client/create-job`
